When a computer model is stochastic, its surrogate should also be stochastic. However, most models for stochastic surrogates are conditionally Gaussian, which can be inappropriate especially when summaries of functional outputs are used. Here we propose a non-parametric model for stochastic surrogates of stochastic computer models, where the conditional probability distributions can be asymmetric and multi-modal. Our method exploits the geometric structure of modal manifolds, which are learned from non-parametric modal regression, and estimates the conditional distributions around modal manifolds non-parametrically. We apply our method to an ocean pollutant transport model, and use the surrogate for uncertainty quantification problems relevant to oil-spill emergency planning.","tags":[],"title":"Manifold Surrogate of Computer Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ruda Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602882255,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602882255,"objectID":"bd511ac99fffdadd69974edda5bd5373","permalink":"https://ruda.city/publication/acceleratedscms/","publishdate":"2020-10-16T17:04:15-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/acceleratedscms/","section":"publication","summary":"Subspace-constrained Mean Shift (SCMS) is an iterative algorithm for non-parametric ridge estimation. Although SCMS is computationally feasible, it is only linearly convergent and its computational complexity per iteration is quadratic in sample size and cubic in data dimension. Here I propose Subspace-constrained Accelerated Mean Shift (SAMS), two accelerated variants of SCMS. The first (SAMS1) is also linearly convergent, but its computational complexity per iteration is linear in both sample size and data dimension. The second (SAMS2) is quadratically convergent, and its computational complexity per iteration is linear in sample size and quadratic in data dimension. Such speed-ups are achieved by using local density kernels, partial eigen-decomposition, and Newton-type root-finding methods. I provide an error bound of local estimate of the mean shift vector, and provide selection rules for neighbor size and kernel bandwidth. I also prove the convergence of SAMS update sequences.

Here we propose Manifold Scaffold, a generative model for data concentrated near a manifold. First we estimate the data manifold using subspace-constrained accelerated mean shift (SAMS). Then we estimate the probability density on the estimated manifold using Riemannian kernel (RK), which can be sampled using a SAMS-based second-order retraction. Conditional distributions on normal spaces of the estimated manifold can be estimated discretely by normal-bundle bootstrap or continuously using Gaussian kernels. Combining the marginal and conditional models gives a joint generative model. We give benchmark results of Manifold Scaffold against KDE, manifold Parzen windows, and the PLoM method by Soize and Ghanem (2016).","tags":[],"title":"Manifold Scaffold Sampling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ruda Zhang","Roger Ghanem"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602879766,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602879766,"objectID":"528b6c2cdd84fe6ed70b67fdda5abebc","permalink":"https://ruda.city/publication/riemanniankernel/","publishdate":"2020-10-16T16:22:46-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/riemanniankernel/","section":"publication","summary":"For probability density estimation on Riemannian manifolds, many methods have been proposed, parametric or non-parametric. However, whether they can be implemented for general manifolds is in question. Here we propose a kernel-based method for density estimation and sampling of singular measures supported on Riemannian submanifolds. Based on the theory of Pelletier (2005), the kernels are functions of the Riemannian geodesic distance on the submanifold, which we estimate from a neighborhood graph of data. To improve the estimate of geodesic distances, we densify the graph by numerical retraction. With an estimated kernel bandwidth, we can sample from the model using the same retraction. Our method applies to both constraint manifolds and data manifolds, and is more efficient compared with diffusion-based methods and eigenfunction projection.","tags":[],"title":"Kernel Density Estimation and Sampling on Riemmanian Submanifolds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ruda Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602876931,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602876931,"objectID":"37f5d729b9b2ec1ec0be2d30e1b36eaf","permalink":"https://ruda.city/publication/newtonretraction/","publishdate":"2020-10-16T15:35:31-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/newtonretraction/","section":"publication","summary":"Newton retraction is always stabler and faster than orthographic retraction, aka oblique projection.","tags":[],"title":"Newton Retraction as Approximate Geodesics on Submanifolds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ruda Zhang","Roger Ghanem"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602875747,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602875747,"objectID":"9668f7063a9ba6e4c626772f24697c93","permalink":"https://ruda.city/publication/nbb/","publishdate":"2020-10-16T15:15:47-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/nbb/","section":"publication","summary":"A method that generates new data which preserve the geometric structure of a given data set, with applications in inference and data augmentation.","tags":[],"title":"Normal-bundle Bootstrap","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ruda Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"plmr, an R package for PLoM.\n","date":1546363809,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546363809,"objectID":"36a88e96660ee41b2666c7be2fa5442b","permalink":"https://ruda.city/project/plom/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T13:30:09-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/plom/","section":"project","summary":"Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds.","tags":["research","software"],"title":"PLoM","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ruda Zhang","Roger Ghanem"],"categories":null,"content":"   Dynamic equilibrium of taxi transportation.
